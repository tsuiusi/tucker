# Bot to make money from posting stupid shit


## Instructions:
1. To use OpenAI API Key first source ~/.bashrc (because I'll likely forget where it was)


Twitter acc that incorrectly pronounces words with misleading definitions, ad revenue
* Scrape word of the day from different websites (maybe top 10 most searched words? and keep a dictionary so there won't be repeats for a month?)
* Fine tune ai to do stupid shit
* Use twitter api to post on regular intervals
* Profit

Scrape -> AI to process word and definition -> shows me for verification (maybe on discord if I'm trying to be fancy, whatsappp api if i want to do it for work, start with something stupidly simple) -> posts on twitter (get blue checkmark)

think about advertising and sales. sales from day one to get that good good ad revenue. 

time the search to run once a day and to post randomly between every 0-7 hours, gaussian distribution it.

make it work first then change from gpt4 to mixtral

scrape.py - Gets the WOTD
rnd.py - wRites and Defines the words returned
run_dict.py - Keeps a running dictionary of what words have been added (can it be dated?)
links.txt - links
