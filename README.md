# Bot to make money from posting stupid shit


## Instructions:
1. To use OpenAI API Key first source ~/.bashrc (because I'll likely forget where it was)


Twitter acc that incorrectly pronounces words with misleading definitions, ad revenue
* Scrape word of the day from different websites (maybe top 10 most searched words? and keep a dictionary so there won't be repeats for a month?)
* Fine tune ai to do stupid shit
* Use twitter api to post on regular intervals (gaussian distribution of 0-7 hours)(a script that does that for a day and basically runs the script when the time is right)
* Profit

Scrape -> AI to process word and definition -> shows me for verification (maybe on discord if I'm trying to be fancy, whatsappp api if i want to do it for work, start with something stupidly simple) -> posts on twitter (get blue checkmark)

Desired AI output:
1. Borderline gets me banned
2. Wrong pronunciations
3. Definition makes sense when you see the word but doesn't really work without that context 

make it work first then change from gpt4 to mixtral

scrape.py - Gets the WOTD
rnd.py - wRites and Defines the words returned
run_dict.py - Keeps a running dictionary of what words have been added (can it be dated?)
links.txt - links
